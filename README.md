# RedMatic HomeKit

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/redmatic-homekit)

> HAP-Nodejs based Node-RED nodes to create (bridged) HomeKit Accessories

__Offers:__
* Universal Nodes to create arbitrary Bridged HomeKit accessories that can be used for anything available in Node-RED. 
* Nodes to create Camera and TV-Remote accessories.
* Special node to conveniently autocreate HomeKit accessories from Homematic devices connected via 
[node-red-contrib-ccu](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-ccu).
* Special node to conveniently autocreate HomeKit accessories from Zigbee devices connected via
[node-red-contrib-zigbee](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/node-red-contrib-zigbee).
* Special node to create an auto-resetting Switch accessory - kind of a "HomeKit Pseudobutton" to trigger Actions.

This is kind of a sub-project of [RedMatic](https://github.com/rdmtc/RedMatic) but can be used also apart of RedMatic 
and without node-red-contrib-ccu and node-red-contrib-zigbee.
